function [node,Tx,Rx,vtx, vrx,node_v, varargout] = LinearMobility(number_of_nodes,...
    switch_randomization, time_division, node, node_v, vtx, vrx,...
    Tx_initial, Rx_initial, delt, CADop, Tx, Rx, varargin)
% This function is to generate node locations according linear mobility
% model and to avoid nodes crashing into walls.
%
% INPUT:
% number_of_nodes - number of nodes
% switch_randomization - This is switch to turn ON or OFF randomization.
% 1 = random
% time_division - it is the time instance number
% node - 2d array which contains all node locations
% node_v - 2d array which contains all node velocities
% vtx, vrx are velocities of tx and rx respectively
% Tx_initial and Rx_initial - these are locations of Rx/Tx in first time
% instance
% delt - it is the time interval between consecutive time instances
% CADop - CAD output
% Tx and Rx - these are locations of Rx/Tx in current time instance
% OUTPUT:
% node - 2d array which contains all node locations
% vtx, vrx are velocities of tx and rx respectively
% node_v - 2d array which contains all node velocities
